This repo contains a Chrome extension to set up a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+1) to highlight the tab making sound.

Install it here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/go-to-tab-making-sound-ke/khjmagmbbhdkmaicdhfehehdncmagbig?hl=en&authuser=0

It uses the following Chrome extension APIs:
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/commands/#basic-command
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-query
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-highlight

It doesn't do anything smart if multiple tabs are making sound.
Nothing can save you from such a fate.

If you have multiple Chrome active profiles (and you probably should) then you need to install this on both.
The extension won't highlight audible tabs across profiles :(
