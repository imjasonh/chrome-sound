This repo contains a Chrome extension to set up a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+1) to highlight the tab making sound.

It doesn't do anything smart if multiple tabs are making sound.
Nothing can save you from such a fate.

If you have multiple Chrome active profiles (and you probably should) then you need to install this on both.
The extension won't highlight audible tabs across profiles :(
